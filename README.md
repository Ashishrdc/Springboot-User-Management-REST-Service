# Springboot-User-Management-REST-Service
A backend project in which I have created REST APIs using Springboot to perform CRUD operations to manage the users by creating, fetching and deleting them from the database. <br><br>

I have also implemented Swagger-UI into the application to manage and document the APIs created and all the rest endpoints are secured using the Spring Security i.e you cannot create a POST request without logging in.
<br>
This project uses Spring JPA & MySQL as the database to manage the users.
